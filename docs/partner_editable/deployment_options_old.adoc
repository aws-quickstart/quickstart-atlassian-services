// There are generally two deployment options. If additional are required, add them here

This Quick Start deploys a stand-alone stack containing the {partner-product-name}. Upon deployment, you can use it as the VPC for any number of Atlassian Data Center Quick Start deployments (https://fwd.aws/Wz3Qb[Jira Software/Service Desk Data Center], https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/confluence/[Confluence Data Center], https://fwd.aws/BBeJW[Bitbucket Data Center], and https://fwd.aws/QXEDE[Crowd Data Center]). Deploying multiple Atlassian Data Center products within the same {partner-product-short-name} helps ensure smooth cross-product integration.

This Quick Start allows you to deploy with or without a bastion host. This host enables secure access to nodes within your infrastructure without exposing it to the internet (for more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstart/latest/linux-bastion/architecture.html#bastion-hosts[Bastion Hosts]). You can choose not to provision a bastion host if you prefer to access {partner-product-short-name} nodes through the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html[AWS Systems Manager].

TIP: You can remove the bastion host from an existing {partner-product-short-name}. If you do, you'll also need to unlink the bastion host from any Atlassian Data Center products using the {partner-product-short-name}. For product-specific instructions, refer to the knowledge bases of https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/sjvsOw[Jira], https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NDrzOw[Confluence], https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/SzrzOw[Bitbucket], or https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/eDrzOw[Crowd].

// TIP: The Quick Start for each Atlassian Data Center product (https://fwd.aws/Wz3Qb[Jira Software/Service Desk Data Center], https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/confluence/[Confluence Data Center], https://fwd.aws/BBeJW[Bitbucket Data Center], and https://fwd.aws/QXEDE[Crowd Data Center]). The first template builds the {partner-product-short-name}, and then provisions the Atlassian Data Center product into it. The second template provisions the Atlassian Data Center product into an existing {partner-product-short-name}.
